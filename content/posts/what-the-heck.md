I think I aged-out of hackathons.

We made [What the Heck](https://whattheheck.tech) as a joke submission, mainly aiming for the best `.tech` domain prize that would allow us to keep the domain for the next 10 years. (Until April 2026, it will be at `whattheheck.tech` and after which, probably a `macla.ren` page)
